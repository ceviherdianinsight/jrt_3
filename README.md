#### 1. What is Support and Resistance?

* Support = A price level where downward movement may pause because buying interest picks up. It acts like a “floor” for price.
* Resistance = A price level where upward movement may halt due to selling pressure. It acts like a “ceiling” for price.
* Support & resistance levels are more like zones than exact lines. Price may briefly penetrate a level without “breaking” it.
* A support level can turn into resistance once broken; similarly, a resistance level can become support after a breakout. This is called role reversal.
* How to trade them:
   - Bounce strategy: Buy near support → sell near resistance.
   - Break strategy: Buy when price convincingly breaks resistance → sell when price breaks support. 
* Plotting tips:
  - Use historical swings to identify major support/resistance zones.
  - Look for areas where price has reversed or paused multiple times. 
* Important warnings:
  - Price can “test” a level (i.e., penetrate briefly or create wicks) without genuinely breaking it.
  - Don’t rely solely on one time-frame or one support/resistance line, higher time-frame levels tend to be stronger.

#### 2. Trend Lines

A trend line is a diagonal support or resistance line drawn on a chart by connecting two or more significant price points (lows in an uptrend, highs in a downtrend).

Trend lines help you identify the direction of the trend (up, down, or sideways) and provide potential entry or exit levels when price interacts with the trend line (bounces or breaks). 

While useful, trend lines are not infallible: they can be subjective, and every trend line eventually breaks or becomes invalid. 

* A basic definition: “A trend line is a chart pattern defined by a series of highs or lows that form a straight line.”
* Two main types:
  - Ascending trend line: connects higher lows in an up-trend; acts as diagonal support.
  - Descending trend line: connects lower highs in a down-trend; acts as diagonal resistance. 
* Drawing rules:
  - Connect at least two relevant highs/lows; more touches strengthen the line.
  - After drawing, extend the line forward to project future possible support or resistance.
  - Do not force the market to fit a trend line — if price clearly rejects the line or the slope becomes unrealistic, redraw. 
* How to trade with trend lines:
  - Bounce strategy: price approaches the trend line and bounces off it → trade in direction of trend.
  - Break strategy: price breaks through the trend line (especially with conviction/volume) → this can signal a trend reversal or acceleration. 
* Important caveats:
  - A trend line break may be a fake-out. Confirm with additional tools (volume, other indicators) before committing.
  - Trend lines are subjective, different traders may draw slightly different lines. Their strength often comes from broad market recognition (many traders respecting them).
