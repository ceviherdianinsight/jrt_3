#### 1. What is Support and Resistance?

* Support = A price level where downward movement may pause because buying interest picks up. It acts like a “floor” for price.
* Resistance = A price level where upward movement may halt due to selling pressure. It acts like a “ceiling” for price.
* Support & resistance levels are more like zones than exact lines. Price may briefly penetrate a level without “breaking” it.
* A support level can turn into resistance once broken; similarly, a resistance level can become support after a breakout. This is called role reversal.
* How to trade them:
   - Bounce strategy: Buy near support → sell near resistance.
   - Break strategy: Buy when price convincingly breaks resistance → sell when price breaks support. 
* Plotting tips:
  - Use historical swings to identify major support/resistance zones.
  - Look for areas where price has reversed or paused multiple times. 
* Important warnings:
  - Price can “test” a level (i.e., penetrate briefly or create wicks) without genuinely breaking it.
  - Don’t rely solely on one time-frame or one support/resistance line, higher time-frame levels tend to be stronger.

#### 2. Trend Lines

A trend line is a diagonal support or resistance line drawn on a chart by connecting two or more significant price points (lows in an uptrend, highs in a downtrend).

Trend lines help you identify the direction of the trend (up, down, or sideways) and provide potential entry or exit levels when price interacts with the trend line (bounces or breaks). 

While useful, trend lines are not infallible: they can be subjective, and every trend line eventually breaks or becomes invalid. 

* A basic definition: “A trend line is a chart pattern defined by a series of highs or lows that form a straight line.”
* Two main types:
  - Ascending trend line: connects higher lows in an up-trend; acts as diagonal support.
  - Descending trend line: connects lower highs in a down-trend; acts as diagonal resistance. 
* Drawing rules:
  - Connect at least two relevant highs/lows; more touches strengthen the line.
  - After drawing, extend the line forward to project future possible support or resistance.
  - Do not force the market to fit a trend line, if price clearly rejects the line or the slope becomes unrealistic, redraw. 
* How to trade with trend lines:
  - Bounce strategy: price approaches the trend line and bounces off it → trade in direction of trend.
  - Break strategy: price breaks through the trend line (especially with conviction/volume) → this can signal a trend reversal or acceleration. 
* Important caveats:
  - A trend line break may be a fake-out. Confirm with additional tools (volume, other indicators) before committing.
  - Trend lines are subjective, different traders may draw slightly different lines. Their strength often comes from broad market recognition (many traders respecting them).

#### 3. Trend Channels

A trend channel is formed by drawing a primary trend-line (in an uptrend: connecting higher lows; in a downtrend: lower highs) and then drawing a parallel line at the same angle to capture the opposite extreme of price action. 

The two lines together create a “channel” within which price moves. The upper line acts as a kind of resistance, and the lower line acts like support in the channel. Channels can slope up (ascending), slope down (descending), or be horizontal (sideways/ranging). 

*  Definition: A trend channel is a set of parallel trend lines defined by the highs & lows of price action.
*  Types:
   - Ascending channel: higher highs + higher lows (bullish).
   - Descending channel: lower highs + lower lows (bearish).
   - Horizontal channel: equal highs & lows (ranging market). 
*  How to draw:
   - Identify the main trend-line (connecting major highs or lows).
   - Draw a parallel line at the same angle, touching the opposite extreme (peaks or valleys) to form the channel.
   - Both lines must be roughly parallel; if they diverge, you may be looking at a different pattern (triangle) rather than a pure channel. 
*  Uses for trading:
   - The lower channel line (in an ascending channel) can be a buy zone (support).
   - The upper channel line can be a sell zone (resistance).
   - A breakout above/below the channel may indicate a trend-acceleration or reversal. 
*  Caveats:
   - Channel lines don’t need to be perfectly parallel or contain all price action, real market behaviour is messy.
   - Relying solely on textbook channel shapes is risky, practical flexibility is required.

#### 4. How to Trade Support and Resistance

The article explains how to trade around support and resistance levels by using two main strategies: the Bounce (price holds at a S/R level) and the Break (price convincingly breaks through a S/R level). 

It emphasises the importance of waiting for confirmation rather than jumping straight in when price touches those levels. 

* Bounce strategy:
  - Wait for price to approach a support (or resistance) zone and confirm a bounce before entering a trade.
  - Avoid placing an entry right on the line expecting it to hold without any confirmation. 
* Break strategy:
  - Recognise that support/resistance levels do break, so you must also know how to trade after a break.
  - Two ways to trade the break:
    - Aggressive: enter immediately when price convincingly breaks a zone.
    - Conservative: wait for a pull-back to the broken level (now acting as the opposite S/R) and enter after confirmation. 
* Confirmation matters:
  - Waiting for price behaviour (bounce or retest) reduces risk of being caught in a false move.
  - Use stop-loss orders: “Never ever hold on to a trade just because of hope”. 
* Support/Resistance as zones, not lines: Price may briefly pierce levels (shadows/wicks) without meaning a genuine break. 
* Role reversal: Once a support breaks, it can become new resistance; once resistance breaks, it can turn into support. (Implied within the “break” strategy discussion).

#### 5. Psychological Levels

* A psychological level is a price level perceived as important by traders and investors, usually because it’s a round number or because it has previously acted as support/resistance.
* These levels aren’t inherently valuable by fundamentals, they gain significance because of collective trader behaviour & perception.
* Examples:
  - Round numbers ending in “00” (e.g., 100.00, 1.5000) or halfway points like “50”.
  - Previous highs/lows that market participants remember or anchor on.
  - Major moving averages or other levels which have a history of price reactions, if widely watched, they can become psychological levels. 
* Why they matter:
  - Because many traders expect price to react at these levels (“bounce” or “break”), there tends to be increased buying or selling pressure when price approaches them.
  - That pressure can create predictable patterns: price may slow, stall, reverse, or break out with momentum at these levels. 
* How to trade them:
  - Identify the psychological levels by looking for round numbers, major prior reaction points, or widely followed moving averages.
  - Observe price behaviour as it approaches the level, look for increased volatility, clusters of orders, or signs of traders reacting.
  - Plan entries/exits: e.g., if price is bouncing off a psychological level, consider entry near the level with a stop just beyond it; if price breaks through, a breakout trade may be triggered. 
* Caveats:
  - Although psychological levels often influence price, they are not guaranteed to hold, they must be confirmed by price action.
  - They work best when combined with other technical tools (support/resistance zones, trend lines, volume, etc.).
  - Be aware of “false breaks”: price may briefly cross (“wick through”) a level then revert.

#### 6. Summary: Trading Support and Resistance

* Support & resistance should be seen as zones, not exact lines.
* A support level is formed when price makes a low before bouncing back; a resistance level is when price makes a high before pulling back.
* Support can become resistance (and vice-versa) when price breaks through and roles reverse. This concept is called role reversal.
* There are three basic trend types relevant to support/resistance:
  - Uptrend (higher lows)
  - Downtrend (lower highs)
  - Sideways/ranging market 
* One way to trade S & R:
  - Bounce strategy: Enter when price bounces off a support/resistance zone.
  - Break strategy: Enter when price convincingly breaks through the zone — either aggressively (right on break) or conservatively (after a pullback to the broken level).
